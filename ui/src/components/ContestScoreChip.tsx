// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// ⭐ THE SCORE CHIP — the running contest at a glance in every contest log strip
// ("ILQP · 212 pts · 48 Q · 19 mults · 41/hr"), so the cockpit answers "am I counting?"
// without a trip to the Contest screen.
//
// THE SAME NUMBERS THE CONTEST SCREEN SHOWS, FROM THE SAME PLACES — never a second scoring
// path. Each is read off the session the engine serialises, exactly as the scoreboard's
// tiles read it (`FieldDayScoreboard`, ContestView.tsx):
//   • points — `totalScore`, the engine's claimed total. LEFT OUT when the session carries
//     none (a Remote view of an older station): the screen then falls back to working one
//     out from settings this strip does not hold, and a total that could disagree with the
//     screen is worse than no total.
//   • Q — `qsoCount`.
//   • mults — `multCount` when the ruleset counts multipliers; otherwise the worked
//     `sections`, which is the second tile the screen shows for both Field Days.
//   • /hr — the scoreboard's FIRST rate tile: `contestRate`'s last-ten window, per hour,
//     measured to now on the same five-second clock, so it decays while nothing is logged;
//     the screen's em dash when there is no reading yet.
// The contest is named as the screen's header names it (`contestShortName`).
//
// Only while a contest runs: every host renders it only while it holds a session.
//
// ⚠️ IT NEVER MOVES THE STRIP, and it has TWO PLACES because the strip has two widths:
//   • 'head' — a cockpit that frames its contest strip in a Log pane (CW, Phone, RTTY, PSK)
//     shows it in that pane's head, beside the one-word title. That strip sits in a log
//     column of 24–44em, where its own header row has no room left at all.
//   • 'strip' — a host with no frame (Satellites, the contest logger window) shows it in the
//     strip's own header row as a ZERO-COST SLOT (`.le-fd-score`): every other item in that
//     row lays out exactly as it did without it, and the chip takes only the room left.
// Either face clips with an ellipsis rather than wrap or grow — the whole reading is its
// title. Both are measurements in headless Chrome; jsdom lays out nothing.
