// THE CONTEST LOG STRIP'S ALT+W AND CTRL+O (Ctrl+D, the third of its keys here, is
// `contestRemoval.ts`'s):
//
//   Alt+W wipes the log line and releases the serial number in flight, and a second Alt+W right
//   after puts it back (`LogEntry` keeps the line it wiped);
//   Ctrl+O sets the operator call: it takes the caret to the operator box.
//
// THE OPERATOR BOX IS NOT THE STRIP'S. It is the Contest screen's — on the title line of its large
// log line while a contest runs (`ContestLargeEntry`), else in its scoreboard (`FieldDayScoreboard`)
// — so the strip only ASKS, by a window event, and the window that holds the strip answers: the main
// window shows its Contest screen, and the contest logger window has its own on its entry. Nothing
// here keys, stops or holds back a transmission, and asking changes no mode: the station's FT role
// is what it was.
