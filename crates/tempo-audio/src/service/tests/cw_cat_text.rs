//! ⛔ THE RADIO'S OWN CW KEYER IS NEVER HANDED A `;`. Hamlib sends the CAT keyer's text inside a
//! radio command (`send_morse`: `KY <text>;` to a Kenwood or an Elecraft, `KM1<text>;` to a newer
//! Yaesu), and those radios end a command at the first `;`: one in the text ended the keyer's
//! command early, and the radio read the rest as a command of its own. Hamlib's TS-2000 backend
//! wrote `KY TEST;` and then `FA00007000000      ;` for `b TEST;FA00007000000` (rigctl 4.5.5, a
//! fake radio on a pty): a retune to 7.000 MHz while the radio keys CW. The text reaches the
//! keyer from the operator's typing and macros, from Enter Sends Message, from a callbook
//! (`{HISNAME}`, `{HISSTATE}`) and from a computer driving the station. A message holding a
//! character the radio's keyer is never handed is refused whole before any of it keys, so Enter
//! Sends Message never logs a contact whose exchange stopped part way; the keyer's own check on
//! each word stays behind it. Each test runs the real `RadioLoop::step` against a rigctld that
//! records every line exactly as it was sent.
