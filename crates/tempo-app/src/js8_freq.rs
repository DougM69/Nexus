//! JS8 frequencies, the decode filter, QSY to centre, the band schedule and DIRECTED.TXT —
//! JS8Call 3.0.3's Settings ▸ Frequencies, its waterfall controls and its directed-message log,
//! read as the spec (`JS8_UI/mainwindow.cpp`, `JS8_UI/WideGraph.cpp`, `JS8_UI/Configuration.cpp`,
//! `JS8_Mainwindow/processCommandActivity.cpp`, `JS8_Mainwindow/processBufferedActivity.cpp`).
//! A CHILD module of `engine` (declared with `#[path]` there, as `js8.rs` is), so it reaches the
//! engine's private fields without widening any visibility.
//!
//! NOTHING HERE KEYS. Two things here MOVE THE RIG, and both go through the operator's own tune
//! path ([`Engine::set_frequency`]) with every guard it carries (radio routing, the TX halt on a
//! band change, the TX-gate generation bump, split cleared), plus one of their own: neither moves
//! the dial while the station is on the air ([`Engine::on_air`]) or a JS8 message is still going
//! out ([`Engine::js8_message_going_out`]).
//! - **QSY to centre** ([`Engine::js8_qsy_to_centre`]): the operator's press.
//! - **The band schedule** ([`Engine::js8_freq_tick`]): OFF by default. On, it changes the
//!   frequency BY ITSELF, with nobody at the radio, after the 30-second notice JS8Call shows.
//!
//! The rest is receive-side or bookkeeping: the decode filter narrows what the JS8 decoder
//! searches ([`Engine::js8_filter_window`]), the dial last used on JS8 is remembered for "return
//! to the last used frequency" ([`Engine::js8_return_dial`]), and every directed message heard is
//! written to DIRECTED.TXT beside ALL.TXT ([`js8_directed_line`]).
