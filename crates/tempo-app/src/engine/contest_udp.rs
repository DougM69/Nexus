//! ⭐ **A contest contact for the WSJT-X UDP sink, complete** — what WSJT-X sends for every
//! contest QSO it logs (`MainWindow::acceptQSO`: a `QSOLogged` with the grid, both reports, the
//! power, the frequency on the air, both times, the operator and both exchanges, then a
//! `LoggedADIF` with the record).
//!
//! The slot loop's contest emitter used to build its `QSOLogged` from the snapshot's display row,
//! which carries none of that: no grid, no reports, the bare dial, the slot's clock as both start
//! and end, the station's call as the operator, and a received exchange read off Field Day's two
//! slots, blank in every other contest. This hands it the row itself, as the Logbook will hold it
//! ([`tempo_core::contest::merge::logged_contact`]).
//!
//! **Read only**: nothing here keys, unkeys, plans or times a transmission, and nothing is written.
